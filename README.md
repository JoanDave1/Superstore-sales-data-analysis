# Superstore-sales-data-analysis

## Introduction

This project explores retail sales performance using the Superstore dataset, focusing on identifying the key factors that drive sales across different regions, customer segments, and product categories. By analyzing four years of sales data (2015–2018), the study aims to uncover patterns in customer purchasing behavior, regional market differences, and category-specific preferences. Understanding these variations is essential for developing data-driven strategies that can improve revenue, optimize product offerings, and strengthen decision-making.
### Objectives

The primary objective of this project is to analyze sales performance across regions, customer segments, product categories, and sub-categories to understand:

* Why certain regions generate more revenue than others

* Which customer segments contribute the most to overall sales

* Which product categories and sub-categories perform best

* Why specific categories are preferred in certain regions or segments

Ultimately, the goal is to identify the key factors influencing purchasing behavior and provide actionable recommendations that can improve revenue, optimize product distribution, and support strategic business decisions.
